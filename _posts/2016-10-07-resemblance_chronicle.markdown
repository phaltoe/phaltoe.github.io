Let’s go back in time,

When I was very young there was one and only one thing that really mattered to me, music. No matter what else I tried to do, I would always come back to music.

You know that feeling when you can’t sleep because your favorite artist is going to play in your town the next evening? Lol, I know it’s weird, but you get the idea, it’s freakin’ awesome!

You prepare yourself, get your speech ready, study their songs and go to the party hoping to have an opportunity to get a few words from him.

Then, you go to a “Festival”. When you finally get a chance to go, there is just one feeling when you experience it, an unforeseen joy. Then, you think to yourself, “One day, I want to be that guy(artist)”.

Perhaps, your dream might come true and you have that beautiful experience. But…wait, let’s put it into perspective. If you stop to think, why may we call it “a dream”? Semantically, is there any difference between dreams and teletransport? I don’t think so. As in teletransport, in your dreams you want to go from A to B not taking in consideration your resource costs. In other words, you are trying to hack our most valuable good, time. And, I am sorry to tell you, it’s a pipedream.

Now, let’s look from a different angle: let’s say you call something you want to achieve as a “goal”. Then, you are going to ask yourself, “What does it take to achieve this goal?”. If it’s too big, you may consider breaking it down in smaller achievable pieces and iterate through the same process over and over until you find yourself comfortable making it to the next milestone. Once you reach that point, perhaps you may find it hasn’t taken many of your resources, in other words, you didn’t try to bite off more than you can chew.

Is there any difference between a dream and a goal? Definitely. One leads to failure and the other to success.
I have been coding for almost a year and just like in music, all the man does is think about code all day long. Seriously, I would even talk to the door if it could teach me a thing or two about coding.

Finally, today, I had the opportunity to attend my first programming conference, I went to the Ruby Conf Brazil. The experience? Amazing! Railing from a small town, it’s my first opportunity to meet people face-to-face that, just like me, love to code. When I heard the talk from Nando Vieira(@fnando on Tweeter) some old thoughts were revived again, my goal was set: one day I want to be that guy.

Thank you Rails Conf BR team and Fabio Akita, it was an awesome experience. See you next year!
