Unlikely most other people I know who are on their way to becoming a software developer, I just discovered this fascinating field late in my life.  Since then, I feel like I have found my true love.  That might be embarrassing to say for some people, not for me.  

At first, I honestly didn't know what to expect when I started learning, my friends and family asked me what I was doing and I would gladly reply: "I don't know, but I am liking it so far".  Yes, it was hard for them to understand. I was abdicating from my comfort zone to jump in an uncharted land.

The only reason I didn't want to look too much into the future, was because if I try to define goals for something I don't know much about, I will often end up putting too much pressure on myself.  Ok, it worked for me.

Right now, if someone asks me: why did you decide to learn software development, I think I would be more capable of answering that.

- Because I like to learn new things and as long as I have something new to learn I will be happy. 

Yes, I genuinely believe that programmers are professional learners.  If you have a good time when you are reading a book, trying to build something you are not familiar with or studying what might the oddest thing,  programming is a career for you too.

A lot of people will say that if you don't have a CS background you can't do it and blah blah blah... "Bullshitalka!".  Don't let people discourage you,  there are a lot of fantastic developers out there that don't have one either.  In fact, programming teaches us that our skills can't be measured by a piece of paper, as long as you can get the job done, you will have job opportunities.

So far, it's been a very fun ride and I will keep you guys updated.

Best regards,
Pedro
